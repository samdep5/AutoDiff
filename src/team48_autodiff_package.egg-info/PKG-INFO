# Broader Impact and inclusivity Statement

  **Broader Impact**
  
  Our software is intended to help people efficiently and conveniently find the derivatives and gradients of functions. Derivative calculators like Wolfram or graphing calculators are widely available, but an automatic differentiation package is particularly powerful because of its O(1) speed and ability to integrate into other programs. Our hope is that individuals will use this software in machine learning, game theory, mathematics, and other applicable fields to contribute meaningful, positive work to society as a whole. Misuses of this package could be as trivial as a high schooler cheating on calculus homework to working on serious ML research with the goal of personal game at the expense of others. As previously mentioned, our package has particular applications in AI, and significant and possible uses of our package could involve the creation of a model that can defeat any human at a game, which could be particularly problematic if an individual with a gambling addiction was pitted against such a model. One such example of this is the AlphaZero engine from chess:

  While the latter example is exciting, it can easily be used by humans to cheat in online matches or even in in-person tournaments if a player smuggles in a device. With great computing power comes great responsibility, and we encourage our users to consider the consequences of their potential usage of our package.

  **Software Inclusivity**

  We encourage all people to use this software regardless of age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, national origin, or any other personal characteristics. That being said, we understand that the software is not equally accessible to everyone. For one thing, all of the comments, docstrings, command names, and this documentation file are in english or use english-based naming conventions. As the authors of this package, we are the most comfortable with English and didnâ€™t have the resources or time to write multiple versions of the code. Fortunately, most of the actual interface only requires the user to read mathematical symbols and numbers. While the user will need to translate some minor documentation to understand how the AutoDiff object works, it is fairly straightforward and can be called without significant English knowledge.
